<h2>Redux Toolkit</h2>

Must export reducer as well as Function in Slice File

Slice must includes three properties : 

Name: "Any String",

InitialState = {Object for Object based declarations}

reducers for functionality and Properties with state and Actions as Parameter where state is current values and action is passed values to App.

We have EXPORT reducer as const with "<SliceVariableName>.action"
We have EXPORT reducer as default with "<SliceVariableName>.reducer"
